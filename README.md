## WHAT IS IT?
This is a game of 3D Minesweeper. There are landmines hidden within the various boxes that comprise the giant cube that you see on your screen.
## HOW IT WORKS
Selecting a cube using the "Not A Bomb" button will cause a number to appear. That number will tell you how many adjacent mines there are in the selected patch's neighboring cubes.
If you happen to select a box that contains a landmine, you lose the game.
The game is won when all the safe boxes have been revealed and only the boxes containing landmines are left.
## HOW TO USE IT
To set up a new game, press the "New Game" button so that the field will be reset and mines will be rescattered across the playing field.
After setting up the field, you can begin playing by pressing the "Go" button.
You should notice one cube in particular will begin to flash and blink slowly. This is the selected cube. To select a different cube, press the W, A, S, or D keys to select a new cube above, to the left of, to the right of, or below the currently selected cube, respectively.
The "Not a Bomb" button is the button that allows the player to select a cube and make it disappear, leaving a number in its place that will indicate how many adjacent mines there are in the selected patch's neighboring cubes.
The "That's A Bomb" button will allow the player to mark a cube as potentially containing a bomb, so that the player will not accidentally open that cube and lose the game.
The "Color Scheme" chooser allows the player to select a color scheme for the general playing field.
