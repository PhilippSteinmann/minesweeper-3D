#Minesweeper 3D

## What Is It?

This is a game of 3D Minesweeper. There are landmines hidden within the various boxes that comprise the giant cube that you see on your screen.

## How To Play

If you're sure that a box does not contain a bomb, you can press "Not A Bomb" (comma) to clear it out. If it actually contains a bomb, you've just killed yourself. If all goes well and it's not a bomb, you'll see a number appear instead of the box. That number will tell you how many mines there are in the its neighboring boxes.
You win when you've labeled all the bombs as such, and managed not to kill yourself in the process. Check out our cool color schemes, and have fun!

## Navigating the World

After setting up the field, you can begin playing by pressing the "Go" button.
You should notice one cube in particular will begin to flash and blink slowly. This is the selected cube. To select a different cube, press the "W", "A", "S", or "D" keys to select a different one horizontally, or use "Q" and "E" to go down or up. You can also zoom in and out using "K" and "L".
